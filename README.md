# sentiment-analysis
Application of a lexicon is one of the two main approaches to sentiment analysis and it involves calculating the sentiment from the semantic orientation of word or phrases that occur in a text. With this approach a dictionary of positive and negative words is required, with a positive or negative sentiment value assigned to each of the words. Different approaches to creating dictionaries have been proposed, including manual and automatic approaches.

Generally speaking, in lexicon-based approaches a piece of text message is represented as a bag of words. Following this representation of the message, sentiment values from the dictionary are assigned to all positive and negative words or phrases within the message. A combining function, such as sum or average, is applied in order to make the final prediction regarding the overall sentiment for the message. Apart from a sentiment value, the aspect of the local context of a word is usually taken into consideration, such as negation or intensification.

* SentiWordnet:
SentiWordNet is made up of tens of thosands of words, there meanings, partof speech represented and the degree of positivity and negativity of the word, ranging from 0 to 1.These words were all derived from the WordNet 2.0 database, which is a database of english wordsand their meanings where terms are organized according tosemantic relations or meanings. Thesewords are all grouped by there synonyms into what is called synsets.So basically, SentiWordNet extends the WordNet by addition of subjectivity information ( + or - ) toevery word in the database.

* TextBlob:
TextBlob is a Python (2 and 3) library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
A good thing about TextBlob is that they are just like python strings. So, you can transform and play with it same like we did in python. Below, I have shown you below some basic tasks. Donâ€™t worry about the syntax, it is just to give you an intuition about how much-related TextBlob is to Python strings.

* VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner):
It uses a list of lexical features (e.g. word) which are labeled as positive or negative according to their semantic orientation to calculate the text sentiment. Vader sentiment returns the probability of a given input sentence to be positive, negative, and neutral.
Vader is optimized for social media data and can yield good results when used with data from Twitter, Facebook, etc. As the above result shows the polarity of the word and their probabilities of being pos, neg neu, and compound.
